# Lifecycle

Mikser processes content through a fixed sequence of phases. Each phase is implemented as a set of hooks — arrays of async functions that are called in registration order.

## Phase Overview

```
runtime.start()
│
├── [INITIALIZE]   Parse CLI options, set logger levels
├── [INITIALIZED]  Resolve folder paths, create directories, clear if requested
├── [LOAD]         Load config file and plugins
├── [LOADED]       Plugins have loaded, journal and catalog are ready
├── [IMPORT]       Scan source folders, populate journal with CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE entries
├── [IMPORTED]     All source entities are in the journal
│
└── runtime.process()   ← repeated on every change in watch mode
    │
    ├── [PROCESS]    Transform entities (map, validate, front-matter, json, yaml)
    ├── [PROCESSED]  Match layouts, provision resources
    ├── [PERSIST]    Write journal changes to the catalog
    ├── [PERSISTED]  Catalog is up to date
    │
    └── runtime.render(signal)
        │
        ├── [BEFORE_RENDER]  Expand paginated entities, queue render tasks
        ├── [RENDER]         Execute render jobs (via workers/queue/pool)
        ├── [AFTER_RENDER]   Write render-details.json
        │
        └── runtime.finalize(signal)
            │
            ├── [FINALIZE]   Write catalog to disk, clean broken symlinks
            └── [FINALIZED]  Log completion, start cron tasks
```

After `finalize`, if `--watch` is enabled, Mikser waits for file system events and calls `runtime.process()` again when a change is detected.

---

## Hook Registration

All hook registration functions are exported from `mikser-core`:

```js
import {
  onInitialize, onInitialized,
  onLoad, onLoaded,
  onImport, onImported,
  onProcess, onProcessed,
  onPersist, onPersisted,
  onBeforeRender, onRender, onAfterRender,
  onCancel, onCancelled,
  onFinalize, onFinalized,
  onSync, onValidate, onComplete
} from 'mikser-core'
```

Hooks are registered before `setup()` is called or inside a plugin's factory function.

---

## Phases in Detail

### Initialize / Initialized

The initialization phase runs once at startup. Use it to set up resources that need to be ready before any config or plugins are loaded.

```js
onInitialize(async () => {
  // Runs before CLI args are parsed
})

onInitialized(async () => {
  // Runs after folders are resolved and created
  // runtime.options.workingFolder, outputFolder, runtimeFolder are available
})
```

**What Mikser does here:**
- Parses CLI arguments and merges into `runtime.options`
- Sets logger level based on `--debug` / `--trace` flags
- Resolves absolute paths for `workingFolder`, `outputFolder`, `runtimeFolder`
- Creates the `runtimeFolder` directory
- Clears `outputFolder` and `runtimeFolder` if `--clear` was set

---

### Load / Loaded

Config loading and plugin instantiation happen here.

```js
onLoad(async () => {
  // config.js has not yet been read
  // Useful for adding plugins programmatically
  runtime.options.plugins.push('my-plugin')
})

onLoaded(async () => {
  // runtime.config is fully populated
  // journal and catalog database connections are open
  // All plugins have been loaded and their hooks registered
})
```

**What Mikser does here:**
- Loads and evaluates `mikser.config.js` (and `config/*.config.js` files)
- Calls `loadPlugin()` for each plugin in `runtime.options.plugins`
- Opens the SQLite journal database
- Opens the lowdb catalog database

---

### Import / Imported

Plugins scan their source folders and populate the journal with CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

```js
onImport(async () => {
  // Scan a source and add entities to the journal
  const paths = await globby('**/*.md', { cwd: myFolder })
  for (const rel of paths) {
    await createEntity({
      id: `/content/${rel}`,
      uri: path.join(myFolder, rel),
      collection: 'posts',
      type: 'post',
      format: path.extname(rel).slice(1)
    })
  }
})

onImported(async () => {
  // All sources have been scanned
})
```

**What built-in plugins do here:**
- `documents`: globs the documents folder, creates or updates document entities
- `files`: globs the files folder, creates file entities
- `layouts`: globs the layouts folder, creates layout entities
- `assets`: loads preset JS modules from the presets folder
- `resources`: scans entities for CDN URLs and provisions local copies

---

### Process / Processed

Entities in the journal are transformed. This is where mappers, validators, front-matter parsing, and layout matching run.

```js
onProcess(async (signal) => {
  // Transform entities in the journal
  for await (const { entity, operation } of useJournal('My transform', ['CREATE', 'UPDATE'], signal)) {
    if (entity.collection !== 'posts') continue
    entity.meta.slug = entity.name.split('/').pop()
    await updateEntity(entity)
  }
})

onProcessed(async (signal) => {
  // All transformations complete
})
```

The `signal` argument is an `AbortSignal` — check `signal.aborted` when doing long work and throw `AbortError` to cancel cleanly. This is important in watch mode where a new file change can interrupt an in-progress run.

**What built-in plugins do here:**
- Front-matter / JSON / YAML plugins parse `entity.content` and populate `entity.meta`
- `mapper`: runs custom entity transforms
- `layouts`: matches entities to layout files, sets `entity.layout`
- `resources`: maps CDN URLs in entity content to local paths

---

### Persist / Persisted

Journal operations are flushed into the catalog.

```js
onPersist(async () => {
  // Sync journal entries into your own persistent store
})

onPersisted(async () => {
  // runtime.catalog is up to date
})
```

**What Mikser does here:**
- Reads CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operations from the journal
- Applies them to `runtime.catalog` (the lowdb instance)

---

### BeforeRender / Render / AfterRender

The render phase executes render jobs. Each RENDER operation in the journal becomes a render job.

```js
onBeforeRender(async (signal) => {
  // Queue up render jobs
  // Layouts plugin expands paginated entities here
  await renderEntity(entity, { renderer: 'hbs' })
})

onRender(async (signal) => {
  // Mikser's own onRender handler processes the RENDER journal entries
  // Each entry calls the render worker/queue/pool
})

onAfterRender(async () => {
  // All render jobs finished
  // render-details.json has been written
})
```

---

### Finalize / Finalized

Cleanup and wrap-up after rendering.

```js
onFinalize(async (signal) => {
  // Write additional output files, compress, etc.
})

onFinalized(async () => {
  // Everything is done
  // Good place to trigger deployment
})
```

**What Mikser does here:**
- `catalog.js` writes `catalog.json` to disk
- `engine.js` cleans up broken symlinks in the output folder
- `manager.js` starts scheduled cron tasks (if any)

---

### Cancel / Cancelled

In watch mode, when a new file change arrives while processing is in progress, Mikser cancels the current run.

```js
onCancel(async () => {
  // Abort any long-running work
  // (called before the abort signal is sent)
})

onCancelled(async () => {
  // Cleanup after a cancelled run
  // A new process() call will follow immediately
})
```

---

## One-Shot Hooks

Most hooks accept a `once` flag. When `true`, the callback runs only on the first invocation:

```js
onProcess(async (signal) => {
  // This runs every time process() is called
})

onProcess(async (signal) => {
  // This runs only once, even in watch mode
}, true)
```

---

## Sync Hook

The sync hook is how plugins decide whether a file system event should trigger a rebuild:

```js
import { onSync } from 'mikser-core'

onSync('documents', async (operation) => {
  const { action, name, context } = operation
  // action: CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE | TRIGGER
  // name: collection name (e.g. 'documents')
  // context: { relativePath }

  if (context.relativePath.endsWith('.md')) {
    // Handle the change and return true to trigger process()
    if (action === 'DELETE') {
      await deleteEntity({ id: `/content/${context.relativePath}`, collection: 'documents' })
    } else {
      const entity = await buildEntity(context.relativePath)
      await createEntity(entity)
    }
    return true  // triggers runtime.process()
  }
  return false  // ignore this event
})
```

Return values:
- `true` → event was handled, trigger a `process()` cycle
- `false` → event was explicitly ignored
- `undefined` → event was not handled by this hook (other hooks decide)

---

## Validate Hook

Validates entities before they are written to the journal. Return a string message if invalid; return nothing (or `true`) if valid.

```js
import { onValidate } from 'mikser-core'

onValidate(['CREATE', 'UPDATE'], async (entry) => {
  const { entity, operation } = entry

  if (entity.collection !== 'posts') return  // only validate posts

  if (!entity.meta?.title) {
    return 'Post is missing a title'  // logs warning and skips the entity
  }
})
```

---

## Complete Hook

Called after each entity finishes rendering (regardless of success or failure).

```js
import { onComplete } from 'mikser-core'

onComplete(async (entry) => {
  const { entity, output } = entry
  if (output.success) {
    // entity was rendered successfully
  }
})
```

---

## Error Handling and Abort

When working with `signal` in long-running hooks, always check for abort:

```js
onRender(async (signal) => {
  for await (const entry of useJournal('Rendering', ['RENDER'], signal)) {
    if (signal?.aborted) throw new AbortError()
    // ... do work
  }
})
```

`AbortError` is exported from `mikser-core` and is the expected way to exit a hook cleanly when cancelled.
